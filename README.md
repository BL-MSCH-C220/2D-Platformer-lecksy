# 2D-Platformer
Project 4 for MSCH-220

The beginnings of a basic 2D platformer.

## Implementation
Built with Godot 4.1

## What Makes this a Game?
This project is a game as it resembles a 2D platformer containing student-created assets where the player controls their character, progresses through levels, and can accumulate a score.

## Future Development
If I were to add to this project, I would add more interesting enemies and more intricate levels.
